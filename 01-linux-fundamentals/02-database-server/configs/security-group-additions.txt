# Security Group Additions for Database Server

Additional Inbound Rules:
- PostgreSQL (5432) from 172.31.0.0/16 (private network)

Notes:
- Allow PostgreSQL access only from private network
- Restricts database access to application servers only
- Port 5432 is PostgreSQL default port
- Use specific IP ranges instead of 0.0.0.0/0 for security
